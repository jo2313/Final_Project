               <p>Instagram is an American photo and video sharing social networking service owned by Meta Platforms. It allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters, be organized by hashtags, and be associated with a location via geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.</p>

            <p class="smallQ">How?</p>
            <p>Instagram doesn't have a single algorithm that governs what content people see on the app. Various algorithms, classification techniques, and procedures are used for each purpose.<br>By 2016, people were no longer seeing 70% of all posts in their feeds due to the increase in users and shared content.<br>That's why Instagram developed and introduced a feed that ranks posts based on user's main interests.<br>Instagram uses separate algorithms for each part of the app, tailored to how people use them. They applies different ranking methods to different parts of the app based on how people use them.</p>

            <p class="smallQ">How Instagrm rank Feed & Stories</p>
            <div>Over the years, Instagram has figured out that Feed and Stories are where people want to see content from their friends and family, and every ranking algorithm can break down how it works into several steps.</div>
            <br>1. Define the objects you want to rank.
            <br>2. Next they take all the information they have about what was posted, the people who made those posts, and your preferences. They call these “signals,” and there are thousands of them. The signlas include everything from when a post was shared to whether you’re using a phone or the web to how often you like videos. 
            <br>3. From there they make a set of predictions. These are educated guesses at how likely you are to interact with a post in different ways.

            <p class="smallQ">How Instagrm rank Explore</p>
            <div>The Explore tab is where you discover new content. This space is made up of photos and videos that Instagram finds for you.</div>
            <br>1. Define the posts you want to rank. Instagram looks at signals like posts you've previously liked, saved, and commented on to find photos and videos that might be of interest to you.
            <br>2. Sort the content in order of predicted interest for each individual piece of content. The best way to guess how interested you are in something is to predict how likely you are to do something with the post. The most important actions include likes, saves, and shares.
            <br>3. When problematic content is discovered, the applicable rules change. They call these our Recommendations Guidelines. This includes avoiding posts that may be offensive or sensitive.

            <p class="smallQ">How Instagrm rank Reels</p>
            <div>Reels is a space that brings you joy. Most of the content you see in Reels comes from accounts you don't follow. They find a bunch of Reels that you might like, and then sort them based on their predictions about how interesting you might be in those Reels.</div>
            <br>1. They ask people through surveys whether they find certain reels enjoyable or entertaining, and learn from that feedback to better figure out what content people will enjoy. The most important information that Instagram predicts is how likely you are to reshare a reel, watch a reel all the way through, like it, and go to the audio page.
            <br>2. The same Recommendation Guidelines that apply to the Explore tab also apply to Reels. For example, they don't recommend reels that are low-resolution or watermarked reels, reels that are muted or contain borders, reels that are majority text, reels that focus on political issues, or reels that have already been posted on Instagram.

         <p class="smallQ">How you can influence what you see</p>
         <div>What content you see or don't see on Instagram largely depends on how you use the app. There are a few more obvious activities you might want to try to directly influence the content you see.</div>

            <div class="instList">
               <br>1. Add accounts to your Favorites list.
               <br>2. Mark recommended posts as ‘not interested’.
               <br>3. Pick your Close Friends.
               <br>4. Mute people you’re not interested in. 
               <br>5. Respond to surveys from Instagram.
